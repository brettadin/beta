## Maintaining Implementation Notes

Each time you add or modify functionality:

1. Record the work in `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` using the provided template sections (Feature Summaries, Documentation URLs Consulted, Parsed Data Fields with Provenance, Validation Steps).
2. When noting documentation, rely on the parsed link list derived from [`Training Documents/Reference Links for app v3.docx`](Training%20Documents/Reference%20Links%20for%20app%20v3.docx) as the authoritative source and include any additional references consulted.
3. Update the parsed data fields section with every new or modified field, including its provenance and usage.
4. Document the commands or tests executed to validate the work, along with any pertinent output or evidence.
5. Commit the updates to `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` alongside the code changes so the history remains synchronized with project development.
